It wasn't too long ago when **{name}** found **{ref}** in a sticky situation. Quite literally, actually. **{subj}** {was_were} trying to open a bottle of honey, when all of a sudden, **{subj}** lost **{posad}** grip on the bottle and the honey squirted all over those wonderful clothes of **{pos}** and the rest of **{ref}**!
My friend **{name}** has been a little sad lately. **{subj}** lost **{posad}** notebook, and {is_are} feeling disappointed in **{ref}**, so I decided to try and cheer **{obj}** up alongside another friend of **{pos}**. The two of us baked a cake and bought a brand new notebook for **{obj}**, we're giving it to **{obj}** tomorrow!
**{name}** was feeling very proud of **{ref}** —**{subj}** had just finished **{posad}** homework! Now there was nothing between **{obj}** and those games **{subj}** bought last weekend.
Have you met my friend **{name}**? **{subj}** {is_are} pretty cool! That's **{obj}** over there, see **{posad}** bright purple shirt? **{subj}** {has_have} been in my D&D group for a long time and we always have fun with **{obj}**. **{subj}** once fought off two ice dragons all by **{ref}** with those rad magic spells of **{pos}**.
**{name}** looked **{ref}** over in the mirror. **{subj}** thought **{subj}** looked pretty great in this costume, and **{subj}** had even made it **{ref}**. The mask was **{posad}** favorite part. **{subj}** {was_were} going to have so much fun with **{posad}** friends at the costume party!
**{name}** and I went shopping yesterday. **{subj}** bought really cool shoes. We also went to McDonalds where I stole a chicken nugget of **{pospro}** —**{subj}** {was_were} mad at first but it was fine because I paid for **{posad}** food. I had a lot of fun with **{obj}**. **{name}** told me **{subj}** had fun **{ref}**.
**{name}** is experimenting with new pronouns for **{ref}**, to help express that nifty gender of **{pos}**. I told **{obj}** that I support **{obj}** one-hundred-and-ten percent in **{posad}** quest, and I hope **{subj}** find{s} a pronoun set that **{subj}** like{s}!
One evening recently, **{name}** got lost in the forest. **{subj}** {was_were} a bit scared because it was getting dark and **{subj}** couldn't find **{posad}** way back. Luckily, **{subj}** encountered a friendly gnome named Lux who glowed with magical light. **{name}** was glad to find Lux, and asked if Lux would help **{obj}**. The gnome led **{name}** out of the dark forest and back to **{posad}** home, where **{name}** repaid Lux's helpfulness with a cake **{subj}** baked **{ref}**.
**{name}** went to the store to buy **{ref}** some snacks. **{subj}**'ll be back soon. Don't touch **{posad}** stuff while **{subj}** {is_are} gone. That sweater is **{pos}**; **{subj}** forgot to take it with **{obj}**.
"Who cares for you?" said **{name}**, (**{subj}** had grown to **{posad}** full size by this time.) "You're nothing but a pack of cards!"\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon **{obj}**; **{subj}** gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found **{ref}** lying on the bank, with **{posad}** head in the lap of **{posad}** sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon **{posad}** face.\n"Wake up, **{name}** dear!" said **{posad}** sister; "why, what a long sleep you've had!"\n"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said **{name}**, and **{subj}** told **{posad}** sister, as well as **{subj}** could remember them, all these strange Adventures of **{pos}**.
