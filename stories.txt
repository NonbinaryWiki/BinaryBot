It wasn't too long ago when {name} found {ref} in a sticky situation. Quite literally, actually. {subj} {was_were} trying to open a bottle of honey, when all of a sudden, {subj} lost {posad} grip on the bottle and the honey squirted all over those wonderful clothes of {pos} and the rest of {ref}!
My friend {name} has been a little sad lately. {subj} lost {posad} notebook, and {is_are} feeling disappointed in {ref}, so I decided to try and cheer {obj} up alongside another friend of {pos}. The two of us baked a cake and bought a brand new notebook for {obj}, we're giving it to {obj} tomorrow!
{name} was feeling very proud of {ref}- {subj} had just finished {posad} homework! Now there was nothing between {obj} and those games {subj} bought last weekend.
Have you met my friend {name}? {subj} {is_are} pretty cool! That's {obj} over there, see {posad} bright purple shirt? {subj} {has_have} been in my D&D group for a long time and we always have fun with {obj}. {subj} once fought off two ice dragons all by {ref} with those rad magic spells of {pos}.
{name} looked {ref} over in the mirror. {subj} thought {subj} looked pretty great in this costume, and {subj} had even made it {ref}. The mask was {posad} favorite part. {subj} {was_were} going to have so much fun with {posad} friends at the costume party!
{name} and I went shopping yesterday. {subj} bought really cool shoes. We also went to McDonalds where I stole a chicken nugget of {pospro} —{subj} {was_were} mad at first but it was fine because I paid for {posad} food. I had a lot of fun with {obj}. {name} told me {subj} had fun {ref}.
{name} is experimenting with new pronouns for {ref}, to help express that nifty gender of {pos}. I told {obj} that I support {obj} one-hundred-and-ten percent in {posad} quest, and I hope {subj} finds a pronoun set that {subj} likes!
One evening recently, {name} got lost in the forest. {subj} {was_were} a bit scared because it was getting dark and {subj} couldn't find {posad} way back. Luckily, {subj} encountered a friendly gnome named Lux who glowed with magical light. {name} was glad to find Lux, and asked if Lux would help {obj}. The gnome led {name} out of the dark forest and back to {posad} home, where {name} repaid Lux's helpfulness with a cake {subj} baked {ref}.
